## Usage

The simplest possible use is loading gsap-player.js before the closing body tag (you do not need the CSS file) and implementing:

```gsapPlayer({ playerTL: yourtimelinehere });```

This will append the player to document.body. The default timeline name is `tl`, if you're using tl, you only need to call `gsapPlayer();`

## Configurations

### Light Theme

GSAP Player will default to a dark theme, but you can also configure a light theme:

```gsapPlayer({ light: true });```

### Position

By default, the GSAP player will be 80% wide and 40px from the bottom of the viewport. You can configure it to be full-width or flush to the bottom, or slightly higher or lower. Bottom must be in a string.

```
gsapPlayer({
  fullWidth: true,
  bottom: '0'
});
```

If you use full-width and keep the container defaulted to document.body, you should be sure that you've either used a reset or placed `margin: 0 ` on the body due to strange browser defaults.

### Container

By default, the player is instantiated on the body, but if you'd like to change the parent, you can do:

```gsapPlayer({ container: '#foo' });```

You'll need to put position: relative on that containing element to enclose the player spacially in that div. Just a heads up: this won't put the animation in the container as well (the configuration is kept separate for flexibility.
